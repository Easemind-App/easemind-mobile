## About Us ðŸ¤—

Dealing with stress and depression is tough, and existing tools often fall short of providing the personal touch people really need. Our mobile app is designed to uniquely assist individuals in managing their stress. We help users diagnose their mental state through analysis of facial expressions, and by asking simple questions related to BMI, feelings, mood, and thoughts. Based on this information, we provide personalized quotes and positive messages to uplift our users. Additionally, our app includes a daily journal feature to help users monitor their stress levels over time and identify triggers.
